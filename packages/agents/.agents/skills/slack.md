# Slack Automation

Interact with Slack workspaces to check messages, extract data, and automate common tasks.

## Quick Start

Connect to an existing Slack browser session or open Slack:

```bash
# Connect to existing session on port 9222 (typical for already-open Slack)
agent-browser connect 9222

# Or open Slack if not already running
agent-browser open https://app.slack.com
```

Then take a snapshot to see what's available:

```bash
agent-browser snapshot -i
```

## Core Workflow

1. **Connect/Navigate**: Open or connect to Slack
2. **Snapshot**: Get interactive elements with refs (`@e1`, `@e2`, etc.)
3. **Navigate**: Click tabs, expand sections, or navigate to specific channels
4. **Extract/Interact**: Read data or perform actions
5. **Screenshot**: Capture evidence of findings
